The purpose of this task is to conduct a simple linear regression on a dataset that contains information about insurance charges. We’re tasked here to analyse if a person’s age affects their insurance charges.

I used the following steps to perform my analysis:

## Import the Libraries
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib.pyplot
Sklearn

## Import the dataset and cleaning the dataset
I did some data manipulation here to check the information on the dataset, remove duplicates, check the size and display descriptive statistical information.

## Build the linear model with selected columns of interest
